<h2> Mini game implementing minimax algorithm </h2>
<p>
This game uses different levels of difficulty to play vs the machine, this translates to the depth of the tree built by the minimax algorithm and dictates how many movements in advance can the machine perform to decide which action it should take.

<h3>About the game</h3>
The point of the game is to "eat" flowers or grass to get more points than your opponent, flowers reward more points than grass.

The machine's behavior is still far from unbeatable but it's a good excercise to learn the minimax algorithm.
